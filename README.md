## üèÖ What is ICPC?

The **International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)** is one of the most prestigious competitive programming competitions in the world. It brings together university students from around the globe to solve complex algorithmic problems under time constraints. The competition emphasizes problem-solving skills, teamwork, and proficiency in programming.

The **ICPC Assiut University Community** is a local initiative that helps students prepare for the ICPC by providing structured training sheets, resources, and practice problems. These sheets are designed to improve algorithmic thinking and coding skills, making them an excellent starting point for competitive programming.
